// In summary, this package.json file sets up a project named "project" and includes Vite as a development dependency. It provides four scripts that can be run using npm/yarn commands:

// start: This script is used for local development and starts the development server provided by Vite. You can run it with the command npm start or yarn start.

// dev: This script is an alias for start, so running npm run dev or yarn dev will also start the development server.

// build: This script is used to create a production build of the project using Vite. You can run it with the command npm run build or yarn build. The output will be optimized and ready for deployment.

// preview: This script runs the production build locally to preview how the project will look in a production environment. You can run it with the command npm run preview or yarn preview.

// This package.json file is a minimal configuration and can be expanded with more dependencies, scripts, and configurations based on the needs of the project.
